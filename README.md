Hexagon Mini VM

MiniVM is a very simplistic reference implementation Hexagon Virtual Machine which runs on Hexagon hardware.  It is intended to provide just enough functionality to allow a single paravirtualized guest (like the Linux kernel) to run.  This implementation only runs on Hexagon architectures v2 and v3.
